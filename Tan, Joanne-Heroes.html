						<h4>Trojan War</h4>
						Archilles is a main figure in the Trojan War. He was a great leader and commanded fifty ships. <br>
						Archilles is the son of Peleus and Thetis (a nymph). Thetis wamted her son to become immortal. So, she dipped Hercules in the River Stynx. Because she was holding Archilles by the heel, his heel was the only part of his body that was not immortal. That is why Archilles only weakness was his heel.

						<h4>Legend of Perseus</h4>
						Acrisius was told that when his daughter, Danae, bore a son, the son would one day kill him. Acrisius then locked his daughter away so that there would be no possibility of her having a child. However, one day, Zeus became interested in this woman. He snuck in to where Danae was. The day after, she bore a son, named Perseus. Acrisius then locked both of them inside a chest and cast them off into the sea to dispose of them.
						<br>
						The two arrived to Seriphos safely. Dictys, the brother of the ruler, Polydectes, found them and realesed. Afterwards, Perseus quickly grew up. <br>
						Polydectes heard about the beautiful Danae and decided to ask her hand in marriage. She rejected him. Polydectes would have forced her to marry him, but Perseus stopped him.
						<br>
						Due to this incident, Polydectes was furious amd devised a plan to get rid of Perseus. He pretended to marry a woman and had everyone bring gifts. Perseus was too poor and did not have enough money to buy anything. Polydectes pretended to become angry with him. They argued until Perseus said he would bring anything he asked of him. The king then told him to bring him the head of Medusa. 
						<br>
						Perseus then set out on his journey. Athena and Hermes decided to guide him along the way because they were all siblings. Athena gave him her shield, so that he would not have to look at Medusa's eyes. Hermes gave Perseus winged sandals and a sickle. 
						Soon after, he found Medusa's lair and defeated the Gorgon.
						<br>
						Along the way home, Perseus had many adventures. When he arrived at the palace, Perseus showed the head to Polydectes. In result, he was turned into stone.
